# Tomas-Bike-Sales

Hi guys,

So I worked on another Bike sales datset and I was able to get some interesting recommendations. 
We uncovered that there was a 25% increase in the price.
There was a 64% increase in the riders.
This resulted in an increasae in profit and revenue generated.

These observation may not follow the regular logic of price elasticity.
According to this, an increase in price resulted in an increase in demand, which is not applicable in most cases.
My personal recommendation would still be to test the market wuth another slight increase of between 10 -15%.
